# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

#Project Overview

Simulated datasets from Starbucks rewards mobile app contain data that mimics customer behavior. From the datasets, my task is determining demographic groups respond best to each offer type. 

#Problem Statement

Starbucks sends out offer to the users once every few days through rewards mobile app. Offer type is discount, BOGO (buy one get one free) and information. Not all users get the same offer. Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Every offer has validity period, informational offer has 7 days validity and BOGO has 5 days validity. The other important information is user might make purchase through app without having received or seen any offer. 
From the datasets given, my goals are combining transaction, demographic and offer to determine demographic groups respond best to each offer type. 

#Scoring

The robotâ€™s score for the maze is equal to the number of time steps required to execute the second run, plus one thirtieth the number of time steps required to execute the first run. A maximum of one thousand time steps is allotted to complete both runs for a single maze.
Demographic groups respond best will be found out by combining cleaning datasets. The number of demographic groups will be used by Starbucks to maximize number of completed offer as their marketing strategy.
